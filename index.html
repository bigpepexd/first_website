<h1 class="text-dark">Steps to getting movie of the week on bungie.net</h1>
<!-- Headings and paragraphs -->
<h3 class="text-dark">What is movie of the week?</h3>
<p class="text-dark">Movie of the week, which can be shortened to MOTW, is a video posted by someone from the destiny community that shows someones creative expression. There have been plenty of MOTWs over the course of destinys long life span. Every week, content creators looking to win movie of the week submit a video to the bungie.net community creations page and wait until the TWAB to see if they have won. Despite the name, movie of the week can be as short or as long as you want it to be. I've seen hour long videos and I've seen 30 second clips that have both won. There are usually two winners of this contest but if the developers feel like it, they can choose more. To win movie of the week, you have to make an entertaining video that the bungie devs like. On the creations page, users can vote on movies they want to win but at the end of the day, the choice is up to bungie itself for what wins movie of the week. If you win, you and everyone who helped out with the video in any way get an exclusive emblem to show off in game.</p>

<h3 class="text-dark">Step one: Just use thundercrash!</h3>
<p class="text-dark">There has been a few groups of people who have consistently won movie of the week by posting thundercrash videos to the point where it has become a meme in the destiny community. Every week before my friends and I look at the TWAB(This Week At Bungie) post, we speculate what the movie of the week will be and thundercrash videos are always brought up. Credit to the guys making these videos since they obvioulsy have a formula and its working but it does get boring after the first few videos. This step is mostly a joke but could be used as an idea for a MOTW if you think you can make a good thundercrash video.</p>

<h3 class="text-dark">Step two: Have a consistent group to record with. </h3>
<p class="text-dark">Recently, my friends and I decided to try and get a movie of the week win under our belts. This took a few hours to record and since we were all in different time zones, we couldn't record for very long each day. Because of this, there were certain people who couldn't get on at recording times so we had to get other poeple in to help record. This caussed us to miss days of recording because certain key poeple were missing or we couldn't get enough extra people to help out. This is why it is so important to have a good group, because if one person in missing, it puts the whole thing on hiatus.</p>

<h3 class="text-dark">Step three: Be creative and make it your own</h3>
<p class="text-dark">If you post the same type of video as other people do, there is a very low chance you can actually win. Ignoring a few exceptions(such as the thundercrash videos), there aren't too many winners on MOTW that copy other videos they've seen. They may take inspiration from others but they make it their own. The reason the thundercrash videos win so often is because they are very talented editors and can make the videos look unique enough to warrant them winning despite reusing the same concept over and over again.</p>

<h3 class="text-dark">Step four: Be a good sport and try again</h3>
<p class="text-dark">Sometimes, there is just an insanely good editor who took weeks or maybe even months to create their movie of the week and there was little to no chance of you winning in the first place. Don't let this discourage you. My group lost movie of the week because it seemed like bungie was looking for a different type of video than the one we produced that week but we can keep trying, either using the same video or making a brand new one.</p>

<h3 class="text-dark">Step five: Have fun</h3>
<p class="text-dark">This is kinda cheesy but having fun should be the main reason you make movie of the week in the first place. If you go into it with the sole purpose of winning, you will be dissapointed if you don't. My groups had a blast recording ours and even though we didn't win ours, we help our head high because we were proud of what we made and had fun doing it. It's fine if the reason you go for MOTW is to get some fancy emblem but just know you may be more upset with a loss than if you went into it to have fun and show off your work to the community.</p>

<h3>Artist of the Week</h3>
<p>There is also something called artist of the week where, as the name may suggest, bungie devs pick out their favorite art from the community each week. Winning artist of the week doesn't award and sort of emblem like movie of the week does but it is still a cool accomplishment to get your art featured on the TWAB.</p>
